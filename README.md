# Infinite Chessle
**Inspired by Jack Li's Original [Project](https://jackli.gg/chessle)**

See the game here: (https://seidman-ad.am/Infinite-Chessle)

&ensp;I loved playing Jack Li's daily version of chessle and it was a highlight of my day. I always looked forward to playing it in the morning. Recently, I though to myself, "Why can't I continue playing it whenever I want?" So now, it exists.
